# 🌎 WorkWander: Connecting Agencies & Job Seekers Worldwide

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to WorkWander, my little passion project. This is a Facebook-inspired platform that brings labor export agencies and oversea job seekers closer together.

## 🚧 Work in Progress Alert! 🚧

The app is still in the early development stage. As a third-year student, I've got about 30% of the grand vision up and running.

## 👥 Who's This For?

* **Labor Export Agencies**: Businesses that organise the placement of workers in overseas job markets! The app allows agencies to post job offers, manage candidates, and communicate directly with job seekers.
* **Adventure-Seeking Job Hunters**: Individuals looking for overseas work opportunities. The app offers customized job recommendations, the ability to apply for positions, and communication tools to connect with agencies.

## ✨ What's Cookin' (Features I've Got So Far)

1. **Sign Up & Log In**: Users (both agencies and job seekers) can sign up and log in to their accounts.
2. **PBasic Profile Management**: Agencies can create a profile showcasing their services, and job seekers can create a profile with their skills and preferences.
3. **Job Postings**: Agencies can post available job openings, including job details and requirements.
4. **Easy Apply**: Job seekers can browse job listings and apply directly through the platform.
5. **UI Sneak Peek**: I've got the basics for friends lists, posts, and profiles (but don't judge too harshly, I'm still prettying things up! 😉)

## 🔮 What's Next? (Future Features)

* Customized UI: Separate and tailored user interface designs for agencies and job seekers.
* Advanced Search & Filtering: A search feature for job seekers to find positions based on location, skill set, and preferences.
* Chat & Communication: Direct messaging between job seekers and agencies.
* Job Application Tracking: Allow job seekers to track the status of their applications.
* Agency Reviews & Ratings: Enable job seekers to rate agencies based on their experiences.
