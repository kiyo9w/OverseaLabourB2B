# Facebook Clone for Labor Export Agencies

This project is a simple Facebook-like application designed to facilitate interactions between labor export agencies and individuals interested in working overseas. The app follows a B2B model, providing a customized experience for both agencies and job seekers.

## Project Status

This is a third-year student project, and only 30% of the full implementation has been completed. The current version includes basic functionality and a partially designed interface. More features will be added in future updates.

## Target Audience

- **Labor Export Agencies**: Businesses that facilitate the placement of workers in overseas job markets. The app allows agencies to post job offers, manage candidates, and communicate directly with job seekers.
- **Job Seekers**: Individuals looking for overseas work opportunities. The app offers customized job recommendations, the ability to apply for positions, and communication tools to connect with agencies.

## Features (30% Completed)

- **User Registration & Login**: Users (both agencies and job seekers) can sign up and log in to their accounts.
- **Basic Profile Management**: Agencies can create a profile showcasing their services, and job seekers can create a profile with their skills and preferences.
- **Job Posting (For Agencies)**: Agencies can post available job openings, including job details and requirements.
- **Job Application (For Job Seekers)**: Job seekers can browse job listings and apply directly through the platform.
- **Basic UI For Friendlists, Posts and User Profile**: Most of the current UIs are hard coded.

## Future Features (Planned)

- **Customized UI**: Separate and tailored user interface designs for agencies and job seekers.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: A search feature for job seekers to find positions based on location, skill set, and preferences.
- **Chat & Communication**: Direct messaging between job seekers and agencies.
- **Job Application Tracking**: Allow job seekers to track the status of their applications.
